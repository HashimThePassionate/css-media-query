## 🏗️ What is CSS Grid?

## 📐 What are Media Queries?

**Media Queries** are a fantastic CSS feature that lets you apply styles based on the characteristics of the user's device, such as its screen width, height, or even orientation. They are the backbone of responsive design, enabling your website to look great whether viewed on a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop computer. 📱➡️💻

💡 **How They Work:**
- **Conditional Styling**: Apply CSS rules only when certain conditions (like screen width) are met.
- **Device Adaptation**: Adjust layouts and content for different screen sizes.
- **Future-Proof Design**: Prepare your website for any device, no matter how big or small.
